23,Kettlebell 3-point leg extension,"The kettlebell 3-point leg extension is a dynamic core exercise performed around and over a kettlebell or other short, stationary object. It is similar in some ways to a V-up or reverse crunch, but targets both the obliques and the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. It can be performed for reps or for time, usually in dedicated ab training or as part of a kettlebell and bodyweight circuit workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,0,,

25,Burpee over kettlebell,"The burpee over kettlebell is a more advanced version of a popular conditioning exercise. If you're performing a circuit that already has both burpees and kettlebell movements, it's a simple way to provide a novel stimulus to the muscles of the lower body and create a more athletic style of training.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,,
26,Kettlebell toe-touch,"The kettlebell toe-touch is a more difficult version of a highly popular abdominal movement usually done for high reps. The simple addition of a weight makes the toe-touch far more difficult, providing a different stimulus to the core during training.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,,
27,Kettlebell swing,"The kettlebell swing is a popular lower-body exercise emphasizing the hamstrings, glutes, and back muscles. It is often used to train explosive power, for aerobic or cardiovascular conditioning, in circuit training, or as an accessory movement for the deadlift.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,,
28,Two-way swing,"The two-way kettlebell swing is an exercise that alternates a chest-height kettlebell swing (sometimes called a ""Russian"" or ""hardstyle"" swing) with an overhead kettlebell swing (sometimes called an ""American"" swing). Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,,
29,Kettlebell crab reach,"The kettlebell crab reach is a kettlebell pressing exercise in which the lifter presses a kettlebell overhead while in a modified single-arm bridge position. The simple addition of a weight makes the reach far more difficult, challenging the muscles of the back, shoulders, glutes, and core.",Strength,Abdominals,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,,

88,Landmine twist,"The landmine twist is a rotational abdominal movement performed using an angled barbell anchored at floor level in a landmine device. It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. It targets the deep muscles of the core, including both the obliques and the transversus abdominis. It can be done fast or slow, for time or reps, either in traditional muscle-focused rep ranges such as 8-12 reps per side or for higher rep

Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight.
